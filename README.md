Hey there! I’m Kevin – a software engineer who writes code like poetry (well… sometimes it compiles on the first try).
<br>
Born in Korea 🇰🇷, coding from New Zealand 🇳🇿, dreaming in TypeScript and Java.
<br><br>
☀️ By day, I quietly fix bugs, refactor code no one asked me to, and question the meaning of every API name I write.
<br>
🌙 At night, I think about side projects I may never finish… but still somehow start.
<br><br>
📦 I love clean architecture, beautiful APIs, and databases that don’t lock everything for fun.
<br>
🧠 INFJ brain + dev life = quiet chaos, but always thoughtful solutions.
<br>
💛 A softie for dogs — and especially for my little sunshine, eppunnii.
<br><br>
When I’m not coding, I’m probably:
<br><br>
	•	Optimizing my to-do list… again<br>
	•	Organizing files I’ll never open again<br>
	•	Wondering if “just one more refactor” is a trap (spoiler: it is)
<br><br>
Ping me if you’re into thoughtful code, good coffee, and side projects with questionable roadmaps.
